**Repository Overview**

Welcome to my CMPG323 Project Overview repository! This is where I'll guide you through understanding the structure, workflow, and best practices for managing projects within this repository. I'll outline the requirements, features, and functionalities that ensure effective collaboration, version control, and security throughout our development process.

**1. Repository Purpose**

I've designed this repository to host multiple projects, with each project having its own dedicated repository. These repositories will help us manage and organize the development of distinct features, enhancements, and bug fixes. By separating our projects into individual repositories, we'll maintain clear boundaries, facilitate focused development, and streamline our collaboration.

**2. Project and Repository Integration**

You'll find a diagram that illustrates how we integrate projects and repositories within our development environment. This diagram will give you a visual of how changes flow from local development environments to project-specific repositories and eventually get integrated into our main codebase.

**3. Branching Strategy**

Within each project repository, we'll follow a well-defined branching strategy to ensure organized and efficient development. Our branching strategy consists of the following branches:

- **Main**: The main branch is where our production-ready codebase resides. It contains stable and thoroughly tested features.
- **Develop**: Our ongoing development and integration of new features happen in the develop branch. It's a staging area for upcoming changes.
- **Feature Branches**: Each new feature gets its own dedicated branch created from the develop branch. These branches allow us to work on features independently without disrupting the main codebase or ongoing development.

**4. .gitignore File Usage**

We'll include a .gitignore file in each project repository. This file specifies which files and directories should be excluded from version control. It helps us avoid cluttering the repository with unnecessary files and sensitive data.

**5. Handling Credentials and Sensitive Information**

To maintain security and protect sensitive information, we'll follow these practices:

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive info like API keys, database credentials, and authentication tokens will be stored as environment variables instead of hardcoded into the code.
- **Secret Management**: We'll manage secrets using a secure and reputable secret management solution, ensuring encryption and limited access to authorized personnel.
- **.gitignore**: Our .gitignore file will be set up to exclude any files containing sensitive info, preventing accidental exposure in the repository.

By sticking to these practices, my goal is to uphold a secure and efficient development environment while encouraging collaboration and innovation across our projects.
